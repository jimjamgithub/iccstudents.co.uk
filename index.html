            <h1 class="article-heading">Blooket
            </h1>
            <p>Blooket is a game that is used in class by teachers to help students learn while having fun. It has
              proven very effective over the past few years, and started when the chromebook one to one devices were
              introduced in 2021. Students really enjoy playing them and it does work learning wise.
            <h2>When it is used</h2>
            Usually there is a blooket in class reviewing that lesson's learning after the main learning of the class is
            completed. Ths means it is completed right near the end of the lesson, usally in the last 5 minutes.
            <h2>Hacking in blooket games</h2>
            About 1 and a half years ago from this post being made, "blookethacks.com" was found by a group of year
            nines, who all used it to cheat and win in blooket games. Blooket was banned in that year because of it.
            Someone in that year, who are now year 11, leaked the website to year 7 students(now year 9). However, the
            website got blocked before the year 7 group could utilise them. However, in last year's year 8, a small
            gorup of students found the hacks again on github and started cauing chaos. This kept happening many times
            and the IT department didn't know how to stop it. However, eventually at the start of this year, hacking no
            longer works. However, as teachers are not aware of this yet, they till make the mistake to kick people from
            games sometimes when they are looking higher than normal.</p>

            Sparx Science is a new homework platform and icknield are using it!<br><br>

          <div class="article-content">
            <h1>New homework platform joins icknield</h1>
            <p>Sparx has been widely used across the school, as seen with Sparx Maths and sparx reader. These have been
              very succesful programs in helpng students learn, which is why the school has chosen sparx again with the
              science side of the school.
            <h2>About Sparx Science</h2>
            Like Sparx Maths and Sparx Reader, Sparx Science is a homework learning platform created by Sparx Learning.
            Like Sparx Maths, AI is used to tailor homework to a specific student's needs. As quoted from
            sparxscience.com:
            <br><br>
            <b>
              "Sparx Science creates tailored practice homework for each student, each week, driven by your scheme of
              learning.
              <br><br>
              The practice is both challenging (to ensure students need to think) and, crucially, achievable (so that
              students can be successful)." </b>
            <br><br>
            Sparx science has a question bank containing over 5000 questions, which will be benifical in helping the
            learning of students. They support KS3 science and AQA GCSE science too.</p>
